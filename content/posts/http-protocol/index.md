I spent the evening at the 92Y, listening to an interview with Tim Berners-Lee about the history of his crowning achievement at CERN: the "web". Coincidentally, I had just finished reading Vannevar Bush's *As We May Think* in which he seems to predict the type of system Berners-Lee developed, almost 50 years before the fact. 

The entirety of *As We May Think* is uncanny and funny, but most prescient of all is Bush's idea of a "Memex" - a device that links together material through "paths" that can be codified, saved, and re-trodden at will. Of this he says:

*This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing.*

The idea would eventually be taken up by Ted Nelson, who coined the *Hyperlink*, and then tried to codify it in the now-defunct *Xanadu* project. Of this, Berners-Lee said:

*The reason Xanadu failed was it was siloed. The web was about interpersonal computation - the goal was to share across systems.*

And so, what becomes clear to me is that the development of the HTTP protocol and the web as we know it has more to with with *protocolizing* these shared channels, and doing so in a decentralized way. The brilliance of HTTP, which seems obvious in retrospect, is that it divested truth and authority from any one single source, creating memex-like ways of traversing this universe. The alternative was a centralized, monetized, and insular web, and alternative protocols like Gopher suffered by entertaining the allure of financial mechanisms.
